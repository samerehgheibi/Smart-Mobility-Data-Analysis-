# Smart-Mobility-Data-Analysis-
Smart Mobility Data Analysis for Milano using MongoDB, Python, and Statistical Modeling
# ICT4SM Lab 1 – Milano
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for the ICT4SM Laboratory 1 project 
at Politecnico di Torino. The work focuses on Free-Floating Car Sharing (FFCS) data collected 
for the city of Milano, Italy.

## Overview
The project explores mobility behavior and system utilization trends using real-world car sharing data.
It connects to a remote MongoDB database (`bigdatadb.polito.it:27017`) via `pymongo`, performs
data preprocessing, filtering, and statistical analysis.

## Key Objectives
- Access and query MongoDB collections for car sharing data.
- Analyze booking and parking duration distributions (CDF analysis).
- Filter outliers and study daily/weekly usage patterns.
- Compute system utilization rates and visualize spatial density via heatmaps.

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyMongo, MongoDB, Jupyter Notebook.
